Very simple ruby application that prompts you for the number of rounds you want to play. Created
following the tutorials from pragmaticstudio.
Just enter a number and the game players will randomly find treasures and gain/lose hit points.
You can play as many times as you want until you enter exit/quit.
You can also include your own csv files of any players you want to use. The format is 'player_name, health'
ex: player1, 100
    player2, 40
    player3, 50

To use: install the gem
gem install DemoGame
Run it from the command line with cmd 'demo_game'
